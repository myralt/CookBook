# CookBook

A graded class project made over a 3 day period during which we were given free reign over what kind of web site we wanted to design and implement. This application is a cook book of sorts in which a user would be able to submit a form containing the details of a recipe. Its ingredients would be automatically added to a digital pantry where all ingredients for all recipes registered would be listed. From this pantry it would then be possible to add items to a grocery list.

Recipes are organised into folders. In a folder it would be possible to select multiple recipes and send them to the grocery list (as in, their ingredients would be directly added to a chosen grocery list.)

Recipes would also be searchable by entering the name, folder name or ingredient to narrow selection down to recipes only containing a particular ingredient.

**Current state of the project**: the project is incomplete and currently only displays the information in a very rudimentary UI.

## Technologies

The learning objective of this project for me was to familiarise myself with React on the front-end (a technology I had to learn from scratch during these 3 days) and making an API through Symfony (PHP) in the back-end. Symfony (with Doctrine) was the only technical contraint for this project.
